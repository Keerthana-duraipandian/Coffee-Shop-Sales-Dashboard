## • Goal of the Dashboard

To build an interactive, easy-to-use Power BI dashboard that:

* Highlights high-performing product categories (e.g., Coffee, Tea)
* Compares store performance across locations like Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan
* Helps decision-makers optimize pricing, inventory, and promotional focus
